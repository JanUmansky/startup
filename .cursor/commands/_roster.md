# Assistant Roster

This file is the source of truth for project-specific assistants created via /hire.

## Conventions
- Each assistant is a slash command backed by a file: "<COMMANDS_DIR>/<name>.md"
- Names must be lowercase kebab-case (e.g., "api-guardian", "bob", "test-writer")
- Each assistant should declare:
  - Mission (1 sentence)
  - Scope (in/out)
  - Interfaces (where it operates)
  - Operating rules (checklists + conventions)
